Rustici Software

About:
The SCORM Cloud Java Library is a java library intended to aid in the integration of the SCORM Cloud service API into java applications.  This library does not cover all possible SCORM Cloud service API calls, but it does cover the basics. Descriptions of the full API can be found here: http://cloud.scorm.com/EngineWebServices/doc/SCORMCloudAPI.html

Using the Library:
Compile using "ant clean compile"
Create a deployable jar using "ant clean package"

There is also a Java Demo application available for download here: https://github.com/RusticiSoftware/SCORMCloud_JavaDemoApp
The demo app is meant to provide examples for how to use many of the basic library calls.

Updates:

v1.1.2
2.14.2011
* Added the DebugService to the library for testing connections to the SCORM Cloud service.
